    "overview": "The Jay Leno Show is an American comedy show created by and starring Jay Leno, that aired at 10 p.m. from September 14, 2009 to February 9, 2010 on NBC, after Leno's initial retirement from hosting The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In January 2010, NBC announced that due to affiliate concerns about its effect on their newscasts, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and moved from primetime to 11:35 p.m., the timeslot that had been occupied by The Tonight Show for nearly 60 years.\n\nThe Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien released a public statement saying that he would not participate in moving Tonight to 12:05 a.m., asserting that it would damage the highly respected franchise. Despite much support for O'Brien from both the public and media professionals alike NBC maintained its plan to move Leno to 11:35. On January 21, 2010, NBC reached a $45 million settlement with O'Brien in order to end his contract. Leno resumed his duties as host of Tonight on March 1, 2010. Leno ended on February 9, 2010 after being on the air for only four months, with Entertainment Weekly calling the program television's \"Biggest Bomb of All Time.\"",

Since then, the series has been a consistent weekly institution on VH1, and it is now the main source of music video programming on the channel.\n\nOver the years, a variety of hosts have counted down the top ten or twenty music videos of the week. The show is currently hosted by Jim Shearer. The order of countdown was originally decided by a mix of record sales, radio airplay, video spins, message board posts, and conventional mail, but since 2006, supposedly online votes have directly influenced the countdown.\n\nCurrently, Top 20 Video Countdown airs new episodes on Saturdays at 9 a.m. with encore presentations every Sunday at 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m eastern time.",
